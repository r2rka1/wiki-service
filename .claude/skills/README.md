## Getting Started

### Install skills into an existing project

Copy the skills you need into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:r2rka1/skills.git

# Copy a specific skill into your project
cp -r skills/create-plan /path/to/your-project/.claude/skills/
```

Or use the **setup-skills** skill to automate the installation.

### Use a skill

Once installed, invoke a skill in Claude Code using its slash command:

```
/create-plan
/create-pr
/research
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows a standard layout:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md       # Skill definition and instructions
├── resources/     # Persistent output and data files
└── scripts/       # Reusable scripts for the skill's operations
```

The `SKILL.md` file defines the skill's behavior, workflow steps, and quality rules that Claude Code follows when the skill is invoked.

## Contributing

To add a new skill:

1. Create a directory at the repository root with your skill name
2. Add a `SKILL.md` following the existing skills as templates
3. Include empty `resources/` and `scripts/` directories
4. Submit a pull request
